It was a prototype of the series that we will call "Project 0s", or pronounced "Project Zeroes", because this literally came from John's mind when he was at the bottom of his life, or what he called the "Zero" of his life. Because 10 years ago, no one ever dared to accept him in any job or company that was technology related as they thought of him as a low-class programmer with nothing but ideas, no action and nothing to prove.</p>
